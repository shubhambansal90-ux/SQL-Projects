# 📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis (SQL Project)

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes marketing campaign performance using SQL.  
The dataset (`marketing_campaign_dataset.csv`) includes detailed information about campaigns run by multiple companies—such as acquisition costs, impressions, clicks, ROI, customer segments, demographics, and engagement metrics.

The SQL script (`Marketing Ana 2.sql`) performs:

### 🔹 ETL & Data Cleaning
- Converts `acquisition_cost` from string to numeric.
- Extracts numeric duration values.
- Prepares the dataset for analytical queries.

### 🔹 Company-Level Analytics
- Total campaigns run per company  
- Total acquisition cost (in millions)  
- Average conversion rate  
- Average ROI  

### 🔹 Campaign-Type Analytics
- Total impressions & clicks  
- CPM (cost per thousand impressions)  
- CTR (click-through rate)  
- Average engagement score  
- Average conversion rate  
- Average ROI  

### 🔹 Segmentation & Optimization Insights
Using window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`), the analysis identifies:

- Best campaign for each **target audience**
- Best campaign for each **company**
- Best campaign type for each **company + audience** combination
- Best customer segment for each **company**
- Best campaign type for each **customer segment**

These insights help determine which marketing strategies yield the highest ROI across various demographic and business segments.
